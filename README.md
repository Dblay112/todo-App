Simple To-Do List with jQuery (Learning Project)

This is a basic to-do list application built with jQuery to showcase my understanding of DOM manipulation and event
handling.

Features:

    Users can add new tasks by entering text and pressing Enter in the input field.

        Clicking a task toggles a "completed" class for visual differentiation (styling required in your CSS).
            Clicking the "X" icon next to a task removes it with a fade-out animation.

            Technical Highlights:

                Event Delegation: Uses event delegation on the parent <ul> element for efficient handling of click
                events on dynamically added <li> and <span> elements.
                    DOM Manipulation: Creates new <li> elements with text and "X" icon for deletion using jQuery
                    methods.
                        User Interaction: Responds to user input (clicks and Enter key press) to manage tasks.

                        This project demonstrates my ability to:

                            Work with a JavaScript library (jQuery) for DOM manipulation.
                                Implement basic event handling for user interaction.
                                    Understand the concept of event delegation for efficient event management.
                                        Build a small, interactive application.

                                        Further Development:

                                            Persistence: Store tasks using Local Storage to survive page refreshes.
                                                Enhancements: Add features like task editing, priority levels, or
                                                drag-and-drop reordering.

                                                Note: This is a basic project focused on learning core concepts. Styling
                                                and advanced functionalities can be further implemented.
